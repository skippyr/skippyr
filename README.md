## New Directions
Over the past few years, I’ve explored various domains, experimented with different ideas, and created promising projects. However, I apologize for not being able to keep maintaining them, as I’m starting a new chapter in my life to become a macOS developer, where I’ve discovered my true passion and purpose.

My upcoming open-source projects will be published on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/skippyr). My GitHub account will be solely used to contribute to this platform and preserve my development legacy. If you need to talk, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:skippyr.developer@icloud.com).
